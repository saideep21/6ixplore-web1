### Body

An experience led to an idea
It all started when a university student began looking for taste experiences that matched the pocket.

What started off as an individual quest to discover the hidden gems of Toronto, turned into a mission to create a platform designed to support our local businesses. Toronto - the “6ix” - has a wealth of spots that serve up food or beverage or cultural or entertainment experiences that one would easily overlook and walk past, simply because it was not in plain sight or one did not know about it. This little bit of technology connects your tastes with an experience that matches your pocket, instantly.

While interacting with several unique independent establishments around the city, we learned about their struggles to stay open with soaring rent prices and competition from franchises offering cut-price deals. We decided to create an equalizer on a platform where local restaurateurs can overcome these obstacles and be discovered by foodies that might have overlooked them.

Discover experiences that you’ve missed, and pick places that are perfectly suited to your pocket, mood and taste-buds.

### Features
